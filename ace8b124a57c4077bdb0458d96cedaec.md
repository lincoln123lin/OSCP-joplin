<ins>Understanding of AD Theory</ins>

AD consists of several components

- <ins>Domain Controller (DC):</ins> A Server with AD Domain Services role installed. Hub and core of AD because it stores all info about how the specific instance of AD is configured.
    Also enforces rules that govern how objects within a given windows domain interact with each other, and what services/tools available to end users
- <ins>Domain:</ins> Created when an instance of AD is configured; can add objects, computersâ€¦
- <ins>Organizational Units (OU)</ins>: comparable to file system folders; containers used to store and group other objects.
- <ins>Computer Objects:</ins> Servers/workstations that are 'domain-joined'
- <ins>User Objects:</ins> representation of employees in organization

<ins>AD Enumeration</ins>

Usually comes after a successful exploit/client-side attack against either a domain workstation or server

We would target high privilege member groups (Domain Admins) to gain complete control of every single computer in the domain

Another way is to compromise DC since it may be used to modify all domain-joined computers/execute apps on them. DC also contains the password hashes of every single domain account.

ASSUME WE HAVE COMPROMISED A DOMAIN USER WHO IS A LOCAL ADMIN, to focus on AD-related enumeration and exploitation techniques
