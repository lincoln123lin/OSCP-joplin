<ins>Assessment Methodology</ins>

1.  Gather info about the application
    
    1.  What does the app do?
        
    2.  What language is it written?
        
    3.  What server software is the app running on?
        

Idea is to increase our permissions within the app or pivot to another app/target. Enumeration of new functionality is important in each step of the way.

<ins>Web App Enumeration</ins>

Important to identify the components that make up a web app before attempting to blindly exploit it. Many web app vulns are tech-agnostic. Before launching any attacks on a web app, we should attempt to discover the tech stack in use, which generally contains:

- Programe lang and frameworks
    
- Web server software
    
- Database software
    
- Server OS
    

<ins>Page content and urls:</ins> identify interesting objects e.g. jsp, img, txt;

Using debugger and inspector in firefox

<ins>Response headers</ins>: see 'headers' tab under the the Network section

Refresh page to see what files were interacted and loaded

<ins>Sitemaps</ins>: find the pages that are of interest e.g. Admin console; some examples

- Robots.txt
- Sitemap.xml

Contains clues of the website layout; try to obtain it from the main page e.g. [www.goole.com/robots.txt](http://www.goole.com/robots.txt)

<ins>ADMIN CONSOLE:</ins> e.g. phpmyadmin, tomcat; usually externally exposed by default configs

- Can see if the default configs are used by checking some default files
- PHPmyadmin

- Url - ip/phpmyadmin
- Credentials: root/" "
- Check config for NoPasswordAllowed=false

- Tomcat

- Url - ip:8080/manager/html/
- Credentials: admin/admin

- Wordpress

- Url - wp-admin/login.php
- Credentials: admin/password
- Wordpress db: wp/wp

- MariaDB

- root/root
