Then, on **desktop**, do the following: Open File > Import > ENEX and select your file. The notes will be imported into a new separate notebook. If needed they can then be moved to a different notebook, or the notebook can be renamed, etc. Read [more about Evernote import](https://joplinapp.org/help/#importing-from-evernote).\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Importing from other apps\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\nJoplin can also import notes from [many other apps](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#importing-from-other-applications) as well as [from Markdown or text files](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#importing-from-markdown-files).\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Exporting notes\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\nJoplin can export to the JEX format (Joplin Export file), which is an archive that can contain multiple notes, notebooks, etc. This is a format mostly designed for backup purposes. You may also export to other formats such as plain Markdown files, to JSON or to PDF.
