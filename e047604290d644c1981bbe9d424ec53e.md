Include your process for finding a valid return address, your discovery of bad characters, the full final exploit code used and any MSFvenom command(s) you have used to generate shellcode. Your report must contain informative screenshots of the debugger for each major step taken.\\\n\\\nAdditional Information:\\\n\\\nYou do not need to fuzz the server; a proof of concept can be found on your debugging machine desktop.\\\n\\\nDebugging Machine Information:\\\n\\\nWe have provided a debugging machine available at 192.168.116.113. The debugging machine should only be used during the exploit development process. The debugging machine should not be any indication of the configuration of the target machine. The debugging machine and target machine are not identical. The only similarities between the two machines are the OS, Service Pack, and vulnerable application. The target machine is running the vulnerable application with low privileges. To obtain full points on the machine, you will need to exploit the vulnerable application and then escalate privileges.\\\n\\\nYou can log into the debugging machine using RDP. The username and password are provided below.\\\n\\\nUsername: administrator\\\n\\\nPassword: lab\\\n\\\nWe recommend using xfreerdp to connect to the machine with the following parameters:\\\n\\\n\\\"xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:lab /v:192.168.116.113\\\".\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2005}]"
