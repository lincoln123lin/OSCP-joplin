\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Maximum Potential Points: 20

Main Objectives:

\- Get working exploit on the debugging machine

\- Get low-level local access on the target machine and obtain local.txt file in a valid way

\- Submit local.txt in Control Panel

\- Escalate privileges to get administrative interactive access to the machine and obtain proof.txt file in valid way

\- Submit proof.txt in the Control Panel

\- Provide written detailed documentation of the exploit development process. Explain all the steps taken between reviewing the given proof of concept and finalizing your exploit code. Include your process for finding a valid return address, your discovery of bad characters, the full final exploit code used and any MSFvenom command(s) you have used to generate shellcode. Your report must contain informative screenshots of the debugger for each major step taken.

Additional Information:

You do not need to fuzz the server; a proof of concept can be found on your debugging machine desktop.

Debugging Machine Information:

We have provided a debugging machine available at 192.168.116.113. The debugging machine should only be used during the exploit development process. The debugging machine should not be any indication of the configuration of the target machine. The debugging machine and target machine are not identical. The only similarities between the two machines are the OS, Service Pack, and vulnerable application. The target machine is running the vulnerable application with low privileges. To obtain full points on the machine, you will need to exploit the vulnerable application and then escalate privileges.

You can log into the debugging machine using RDP. The username and password are provided below.

Username: administrator

Password: lab

We recommend using xfreerdp to connect to the machine with the following parameters:

"xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:lab /v:192.168.116.113".
