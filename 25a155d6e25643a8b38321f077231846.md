That is because they get executed by the webserver, since their file-ending says that it contains code. This can be bypassed by using a build-in php-filter.\\\n\\\n> http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=indexÂ \\\n\\\nHere you use a php-filter to convert it all into base64. So in return you get the whole page base64 encoded. Now you only need to decode it. Save the base64-text into a file and then run:\\\n\\\n> base64 -d savefile.php\"]],\"start1\":2952,\"start2\":2952,\"length1\":12,\"length2\":853}]"
