To deter offline attacks, there is SYSKEY feature which partially encrypts the SAM file\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nOlder version of Windows store password hashes in two different forms:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- DES for normal LM, and\\\r\\\n- MD4 for NTLM version\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nLM is known to be weak since long strings and split smaller and the hash value is derived, with the password converted to uppercase before hashing.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nNewer version of Windows DISABLES LM BY DEFAULT. Only uses NTLM, which is case sensitive, supports unicode and does not split the string.\\\r\\\nHowever, NTLM are not salted.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n<ins>Note:</ins> SAM database cannot be copied while OS is running as Windows kernel keeps an exclusive file system lock on the file.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- Can use mimikatz (another module) to mount -in-memory attacks designed to dump SAM hashes.\\\r\\\n    - **Mimikatz** also facilitate password hash extraction from LSASS process memory where they are cached.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nid: 2da13f08ffd547d0a2ff8593445e1992\\\r\\\nparent_id: 0dad434f58c94c608e219795d44a723c\\\r\\\ncreated_time: 2022-01-30T10:16:57.324Z\\\r\\\nupdated_time: 2022-01-30T10:18:17.781Z\\\r\\\nis_conflict: 0\\\r\\\nlatitude: 0.00000000\\\r\\\nlongitude: 0.00000000\\\r\\\naltitude: 0.0000\\\r\\\nauthor: \\\r\\\nsource_url: \\\r\\\nis_todo: 0\\\r\\\ntodo_due: 0\\\r\\\ntodo_completed: 0\\\r\\\nsource: joplin-desktop\\\r\\\nsource_application: net.cozic.joplin-desktop\\\r\\\napplication_data: \\\r\\\norder: 0\\\r\\\nuser_created_time: 2022-01-30T10:16:57.324Z\\\r\\\nuser_updated_time: 2022-01-30T10:18:17.781Z\\\r\\\nencryption_cipher_text: \\\r\\\nencryption_applied: 0\\\r\\\nmarkup_language: 1\\\r\\\nis_shared: 0\\\r\\\nshare_id: \\\r\\\nconflict_original_id: \\\r\\\nmaster_key_id: \\\r\\\ntype_: 1\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1594}]"
