Responder

Responder can do many different kinds of attacks, but for this scenario, it will set up a malicious SMB server. When the target machine attempts to perform the NTLM authentication to that server, Responder sends a challenge back for the server to encrypt with the user's password. When the server responds, Responder will use the challenge and the encrypted response to generate the NetNTLMv2. While we can't reverse the NetNTLMv2, we can try many different common passwords to see if any generate the same challenge response, and if we find one, we know that is the password. This is often referred to as hash cracking, which we'll do with a program called John The Ripper.
