Methods to turn off

4 Ways to do so

1.  Turn off JavaScript in browser - will only work if site doesn't require javascript to provide the basic functionality
2.  Intercept & Modify incoming pageÂ **using BurpSuite** \- Most common method; strip out the javascript filter before it has a chance to run
3.  Intercept & Modify file upload - allows the website to load as normal but intercepts the file upload after it has passed (and been accepted by) the filter
4.  Send the file directory to upload point (via PUT or POST)
    1.  curl -X POST -F "submit=&lt;value&gt;" -F "&lt;fileparam&gt;=@&lt;pathtofile&gt;" &lt;Website&gt;
