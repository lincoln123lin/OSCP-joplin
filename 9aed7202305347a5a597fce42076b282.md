TCPDump

To read PCAP files

To read the dump file -

> sudo tcpdump -r file.pcap

Filter the traffic using awk and sort

> E.g. sudo tcpdump -n -r password\_cracking\_filtered.pcap | awk -F" " '{print $3 }' | sort | uniq -c | head

Example skips DNS name lookups using -n option, print the destination IP and port as filtered in the third space-separated field, sort and unique counted.

To filter from the command line, use src/dst host or port to filter by source/destn hosts or port number

Use option -X to print the packet data in both HEX and ASCII format

Advanced Header Filter \- use TCP flags arrangement to retrieve information required; E.g. To receive ARP or PSH packets, we must manipulate the 4th and 5th bits of the 14th byte of the packet. Thus,

> sudo tcpdump -A -n 'tcp\[13\] = 24' -r password\_cracking\_filtered.pcap

This will display packets that have the ACK or PSH flags set
