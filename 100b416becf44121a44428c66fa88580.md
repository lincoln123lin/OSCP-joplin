XSS and PHP Wrappers

Three variants: Stored, reflected and Dom-based

Stored --- aka Persistent, occurs when the exploit payload is stored in a database or cached by a server.

- Webapp retrieves this payload and displays it to anyone that views a vulnerable page. A single stored XSS vuln can therefore attack all users of the site.

Reflected --- usually crafted payload as a request or link. The web app takes this value and places it into the page content. This variant only attacks the person submitting the request or viewing the link. Reflected XSS vulns can often occur in search fields and results, as well as anywhere user input is included in error messages.

DOM-based --- similar to the other two, but takes place solely within the page's DOM.JS can programmatically interact with DOM. Usually occurs when a browser parses the page's content and inserted JS is executed.

Regardless of how the XSS payload is delivered and executed, the inject scripts run under the context of the user viewing the affected page. Therefore, the user's browser, not the web app, executes the XSS payload. --> may result in session hijacking, forced redirection to malicious pages, execution of local apps as that user, etc.
