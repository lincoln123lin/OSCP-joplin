Maximum Potential Points: 40

You have agreed with the client to perform an external black box penetration test against their Microsoft Windows Active Directory infrastructure.

The final objective of the Active Directory penetration test is to gain Domain Administrator level rights on the network. The Active Directory network can be located at the following IP addresses:

192.168.116.100

192.168.116.101

192.168.116.102

Main Objectives:

\- Get Administrative interactive access to the client machines and obtain local.txt (if applicable and present) and proof.txt files in valid way

\- Get Administrative interactive access to the Domain Controller and obtain proof.txt file in valid way

\- Submit proof.txt files in the Control Panel

Documentation Requirements:

\- Document each step and command of your attack in a way that it can be replicated following a "copy/paste" approach

\- Create screenshots showing various steps and stages of the attack performed

\- Create a valid screenshot showing the content of proof.txt and machine IP address

\- Provide the link or the copy of the script/exploits being used

\- Document any changes done to the original scripts or exploits being used

\- Provide a summary and overview of the vulnerabilities found, performed attacks and exploitation process. You must show all steps executed against the entire Active Directory domain used to obtain Domain Administrator privileges.

To ensure the stability of the Active Directory network, it is not possible to revert a single specific VM. Instead, reverting any of the target machines in the AD network will revert all of the machines at once.

Note that reverting all machines can take a couple of minutes.

There are no dependencies between the Active Directory infrastructure and the freestanding hosts.
