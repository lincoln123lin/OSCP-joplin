If you choose to synchronise with a third-party, such as OneDrive, the notes will be sent to your OneDrive account, in which case the third-party privacy policy applies. | Disabled | Yes |\\\n| Wifi connection check | On mobile, Joplin checks for Wifi connectivity to give the option to synchronise data only when Wifi is enabled. | Enabled | No <sup>(1)</sup> |\\\n\\\n(1) https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/5705\\\n\\\nJoplin is developed as an open-source application and the source code is freely available online to inspect.\\\n\\\nFor any question about Joplin privacy, please leave a message on the [Joplin Forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/).\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1555}]"
