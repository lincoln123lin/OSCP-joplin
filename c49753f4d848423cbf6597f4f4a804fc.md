For XSS

### Protect yourself

The problem with XSS is that it is a bit hard for the users to protect themselves. If there is a problem witht the website there is not that much the user can do.

One can always use noscript to block all javascript code. But that pretty much destroys the whole experience with using the internet.

### Protect your website

There are mainly two ways to protect against **encoding** and **sanitizing** .

#### Encoding

Of course the way to protect your website is to sanitize all input.

You can also set the response-header like this: `-xss-protection:"1; mode=block"`

For nodeJs you can use the helmet-module to do this. https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet

### Risks for the attacker

The obvious risk is that the attacker must expose a server.
